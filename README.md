# Java-ABM-CRUD-

# 🎓 Java ABM System for Educational Institution Management

A university project developed in Java to implement a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing core entities of educational institutions. The project uses PostgreSQL for data persistence and Hibernate as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework, simplifying database operations by mapping Java objects directly to database tables.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project provides a console-based application that enables users to perform essential operations like registering new records, updating existing ones, and deleting outdated data. Built with an object-oriented approach and using **Hibernate ORM** to seamlessly integrate Java objects with the PostgreSQL database, it demonstrates efficient database management and clean architecture.

## 💡 Why This Project is Useful

- 🏫 **Educational management made simple:** Automates administrative tasks by managing academic data effectively.
- 📚 **Hands-on experience:** Ideal for learning Java database connectivity, object-oriented programming, SQL, and ORM with Hibernate.
- 🎓 **University assignment:** Designed as part of a university curriculum to practice Java and database integration.
- 🚀 **Scalable foundation:** Can be extended to include more features like GUI, authentication, or network capabilities.
- 💻 **Lightweight and portable:** Runs on any system with Java, PostgreSQL, and Hibernate dependencies.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📁 Manage Institutes, Subjects, Teachers, and Teaching Positions.
- ✍️ Perform CRUD operations via console input.
